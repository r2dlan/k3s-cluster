# Uptime Kuma ‚Äì Helmfile Deployment

This document explains how to deploy [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) ‚Äì a self-hosted monitoring tool ‚Äì using **Helmfile**.

The deployment is configured via the [uptime-kuma Helm chart](https://github.com/dirsigler/uptime-kuma-helm) and uses a declarative setup suitable for GitOps workflows.

---

## Chart Source

The Helm chart used is hosted at:

```yaml
repositories:
  - name: uptime-kuma
    url: https://dirsigler.github.io/uptime-kuma-helm
```

Make sure your `helmfile.yaml` includes this repository definition.

---

## Release Configuration

Uptime Kuma is deployed as follows:

```yaml
releases:
  - name: uptime-kuma
    namespace: uptime-kuma
    chart: uptime-kuma/uptime-kuma
    version: 2.21.3
    createNamespace: true
    wait: true
    atomic: true
    values:
      - values/kuma.yaml.gotmpl
```

- **Namespace:** `uptime-kuma` (created if it doesn't exist)

   helm repo update
   ```

2. Apply the Helmfile:

   ```bash
